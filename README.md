# POS--Demo-Kotlin-
Building an app that can be used to search for products that Coolblue sells.

Build a very simple app that implements the first User Story in the backlog:
As a user, I want to search for a product, so that I can scroll through a list of products and find something interesting to buy.


## Non-functionals
We also have some non-functional requirements, which you should take into account when developing the application:
● You write Kotlin code.
● You use known design patterns to build a proper architecture.
● You add some tests.
● You use open source components if you need them.
● You use some images to make it a bit visual.

We have a very simple API that you can use for the assignment. It has one endpoint you can use to search for products.

Please notice that the information is mocked. You’ll get the same information back using any search term
